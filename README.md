Hi, I'm Hendrik. I'm mostly programming with C++, scripting with Python, and currently learning Rust. 

Interested in Visual Computing, taming the power of GPUs, and Aerospace Engineering. I'm also learning about cybersecurity and CTF challenges.

If you see my bi-neusal power inverter while looking around, please let me know. And better don't touch it ...
